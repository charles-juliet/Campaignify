You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page will auto-update as you save changes.

### Preventing Spam Emails with ZeroBounce

To prevent invalid or disposable emails from entering your system, the platform integrates **ZeroBounce** for real-time email validation. By using ZeroBounce, you can ensure that only valid email addresses are accepted, reducing bounce rates and improving overall deliverability.

You can use the ZeroBounce API to validate emails before they are added to your mailing list.

### Stripe Subscription Integration

This project provides built-in support for Stripe to manage your SaaS subscriptions. You can create subscription plans, handle billing, and manage user payments directly from the platform.

## Deployment

The easiest way to deploy this platform is via [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). Simply connect your Git repository and Vercel will handle the deployment for you.

Alternatively, you can deploy using custom servers:

- **Vercel**: Follow the [Next.js Deployment Guide](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for easy hosting.
- **AWS SES Setup**: Ensure that your SES account is verified, and set up the correct email addresses for sending.
